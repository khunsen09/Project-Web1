        <p class="lead">Sometime in 1997, Dr. Angelo “Anji” and Dr. Ma. Mercedita “Lana” Alcala opened the idea of building a hospital for the Ilonggos to Dr. Evelyn “Bukay” Lozada, Dr. Roberto “Bob” Lozada and later on to Dr. Danilo “Dan” Encarnacion. Except for Dr. Bob the four were very close friends being classmates in West Visayas State College of Medicine. Drs. Anji & Lana wanted to share their experience, having been involved in the building of several hospitals in Metro Manila.</p>

          The idea did not materialize until 14 years later when idea to build a hospital owned by doctors from Iloilo was revived. The first step taken was the formation of a core group of physicians that would be involved in the initial planning. The members were <b> Dr. Angelo Alcala, Dr. Mercedita Lana, Dr. Danilo Encarnacion, Dr. Evelyn Lozada, Dr. Roberto Lozada, Dr. Roland Uy, Dr. Anton Juan Loa, Dr. Myrna Ong and Dr. Chester Jardiolin. Eventually, other members were recruited to complete the 15 members of the Board and they were – Dr. Danilo Valencia, Dr. Jesse Uy, Dr. Erwin Dulos, Dr. Segundo Anayan, Dr. Hannah Jabasa and Dr. Perpetua Socorro Barrera.</b>

          <p class="lead text-dark mt-3">Secondly, we aim to improve our credibility with our new design. A good-quality, easy-to-use website would surely make our clients feel more comfortable using our service. The aim is for our clients to assume that they can expect that same positive experience through our actual care when they are physically within our premises; and</p>
          <p class="lead text-dark mt-3">Finally, in general, we hope to provide a place that potential clients and stakeholders can be referred to. It will show what our hospital is about, what is has achieved, and what it can achieve in the future.</p>
          <p class="lead text-dark mt-3">I hope that we all continue to support these types of initiatives for a more successful Metro Iloilo Hospital and Medical Center, Inc. Thank you and stay safe always!</p>

          <p class="lead text-dark mt-3">It is with great pride and honor that I stand before you today on this momentous occasion. Today marks the realization of our dream of building a hospital. We have toiled a lot, spent sleepless nights with untiring efforts for the last three years in order to come up with what we have now.</p>
          <p class="lead text-dark mt-3">I would like to recognize the efforts shared by my fellow core members as well as the support from our investors without which this dream would not be realized. the momentum is now with us, the process of building will continue, the pursuit for success still lies ahead. We have just begun, and we will strive further. Together we must work unmindful of personal gains, for a common good, for the good of this hospital.</p>
          <p class="lead text-dark mt-3">So i encourage my fellow Founders, that we must do our part in making this hospital as the shining glory of our efforts for ourselves, our family, our community and most of all for the God Almighty.</p>
